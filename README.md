# Speed Typing Test

## Overview
This is a **Speed Typing Test** application built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It helps users measure their typing speed by providing a randomly selected paragraph to type within a time limit of 60 seconds. The application tracks **words per minute (WPM)**, **total words typed**, **wrong words**, and **accuracy percentage**.

## Features
- Random paragraph generation for typing test
- Real-time countdown timer (60 seconds)
- Tracks **WPM (Words Per Minute)**
- Calculates **Accuracy Percentage**
- Displays **Total Words Typed** and **Wrong Words Count**
- Start and Reset functionality
- User-friendly GUI
